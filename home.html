    <h5>Overcrowded Classes </h5>
    <p><strong>Classroom Problem</strong></p>
    <p>At   Tutor Me Today, we understand that one of the biggest problems facing a   struggling student is simply not getting the attention in the   specific problem areas that they truly need.</span> One on one is the most effective form of instruction, but the public school system simply can't provide enough for the students that need it most. </p>
    <p><strong>Not Their Fault</strong><br />
    </p>
    <p>This   is often not the fault of the teacher, we all know that  in the   Los Angeles area have to deal with severely overpopulated classrooms.   Teachers can only give a student so much of their time and attention. A   student that needs more than what a teacher in an overpopulated   classroom can provide is naturally going to continue to struggle.  We can help! <br />
